# Partials

A partial is a component that represents a piece of reusable content represented on multiple pages.
It is distinct from a widget in that it is broad or even universal in its reach, and likely has a specific placement that remains constant in each page to which it belongs. A widget, on the other hand, could theroetically be "dropped" anywhere and contains a smaller or more specific feature.
Examples: navigation bar, app bar, hamburger menu, header, footer, disclaimer
